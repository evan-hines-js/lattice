//! Kubernetes Event recording for Lattice controllers.
//!
//! Provides a trait-based abstraction over `kube::runtime::events::Recorder`
//! so that controllers can emit standard Kubernetes Events visible via
//! `kubectl describe` and `kubectl get events`.
//!
//! Events are **fire-and-forget**: failures are logged as warnings and never
//! propagate errors. A failed event must never break reconciliation.
