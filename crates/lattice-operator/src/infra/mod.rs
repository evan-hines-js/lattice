//! Infrastructure component manifest generation
//!
//! Provides manifest generators for infrastructure components that Lattice
//! manages on every cluster:
//!
//! - **Cilium**: CNI (deployed at bootstrap, reconciled by controller)
//! - **Istio Ambient**: Service mesh (ztunnel for mTLS, waypoint for L7)
//! - **cert-manager**: Certificate management (CAPI dependency)
//! - **CAPI**: Cluster API providers for self-management
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! Bootstrap webhook generates ALL infrastructure manifests upfront.
//! This allows cert-manager, CAPI, and Istio to install in parallel
//! with the operator starting up.
//!
//! The operator "adopts" pre-installed components by checking if each
//! is already installed and skipping installation if so. This ensures:
//! - Faster cluster creation (parallel installation)
//! - No drift between bootstrap and day-2 reconciliation
//! - Single source of truth for manifest generation
//!
//! # Version Pinning
//!
//! Component versions are pinned to the Lattice release. When Lattice
//! upgrades, the controller applies updated manifests automatically.
